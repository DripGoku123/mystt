Hi! Code programmer from this site! 
The program you are learning from, 
or are going to use, 
is an artificial intelligence that is capable of recognizing the word you are teaching it!
If you have any questions please add me on discord! 
Discord: ._.kitler._.

I'm writing in this txt file to explain
to you how the code I wrote works. 
Let's start with the learn.py


learn.py is the file that is responsible for adding new data to the database, from which we will then train the model. 
It includes two functions, inser_data() is a function that adds our training data to the database, 
and train_data() takes the sound data by pyaudio and converts it into MFCC numerical data in the form of a list. 
train_data() need on the start prediction number which represents the word. Later it will return this number when predicted.


model.py is responsible for training AI model from baza.sqlite3.
It includes two functions, fetch_data() is a function that obtains data from a database and returns it using return.
model() use data from fetch_data() to teach XGBClassifier model and save this to model.pkl.


test.py is responsible for testing my AI model. test() function takes the sound data by pyaudio and again converts to MFCC 
numerical data. Then it print prediction number which I wrote about earlier.



The required libraries for all files are: 
librosa (pip install librosa), 
pyaudio (pip install pyaudio), 
wave (should be installed with python),
sqlite3 (also should already be installed).
xgboost (pip install xgboost)
sklearn (pip install scikit-learn)
pickle (should arleady be installed)
